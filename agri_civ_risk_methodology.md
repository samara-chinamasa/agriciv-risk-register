# Risk Register Methodology ‚Äî AgriCiv Holdings Ltd

This methodology document explains how risks were identified, evaluated, scored, and prioritised in the AgriCiv Risk Register. The register was created as part of a Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) portfolio project simulating real-world risk management in a digitally transforming business in Zimbabwe.

## üîç 1. Risk Identification

Risks were identified based on:

- The company‚Äôs operational and digital transformation context
- Common industry risks in the agriculture and civils sectors
- Known infrastructure challenges in Zimbabwe (e.g. power, currency)
- Realistic scenarios from similar organisations

A total of 12 risks were selected across operational, strategic, technological, and financial domains.

## üßÆ 2. Risk Scoring Criteria

Each risk was scored using a **5-point Likelihood √ó Impact scale**, producing a numeric risk level to assist in prioritisation.

| Rating | Likelihood / Impact Description |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| 1      | Rare / Minimal                  |
| 2      | Unlikely / Minor                |
| 3      | Possible / Moderate             |
| 4      | Likely / Major                  |
| 5      | Almost certain / Critical       |

**Risk Level = Likelihood √ó Impact**, resulting in a score between 1 and 25.

## üìä 3. Risk Prioritisation

After scoring, risks were prioritised as follows:

| Score Range | Risk Level | Action Required                     |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 20‚Äì25       | Critical   | Immediate action and monitoring     |
