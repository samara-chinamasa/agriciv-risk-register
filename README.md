# AgriCiv Risk Register — GRC Portfolio Project

This project showcases a sample **Risk Register** I completed for a fictional company based on a real business case in Zimbabwe’s agriculture and civil engineering sector. It is part of my GRC and Information Security portfolio and reflects my ability to identify, analyse, and mitigate risks in a modernising organisation.
